 
PHPMailer
----------

To send emails using SMTP, lanparty-ripoll needs the library *PHPMailer*. The minimal version of this library can be installed just cloning the content of the repository into this directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.git
```

The lanparty-ripoll code will automatically load the library (if not, you can check the first lines of *includes/send.php* file).
